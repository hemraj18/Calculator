# Calculator

Hello everyone this is my first Tkinter project, in this repo I have created a Calculator.
This calculator allows users to perform arithmetic operations and evaluate expressions. 
The calculator's GUI consists of buttons for digits, arithmetic operators, and other functions like square root
I have also bind the keys so that you can use the buttons using the keyboard.
Just open the code and i have explain all the functions and what is the use of the writen line
